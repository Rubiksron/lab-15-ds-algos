# Data Structures & Algorithms

### Linked Lists

[Data Structures: Linked Lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list)

## To Submit this Assignment
  * fork this repository
  * write all of your code in a directory named `lab-` + `<your name>` **e.g.** `lab-duncan`
  * push to your repository
  * submit a pull request to this repository
  * submit a link to your PR in canvas
  * write a question and observation on canvas

# Include
* gitignore
* eslint
* package.json
* gulpfile
* readme
 * Write a paragraph about your project
 * Document your methods (format them using markdown for clean readability!)
 * Write docs on your implementation and document your Big-O
* tests
  * use chai's expect and should where applicable
  * ensure that all of your codes has test coverage

## Directions
*You should have the `.insert()` and `.size()` methods of a Linked List completed.*
* Complete the implementation of of the Linked List:
  * `.remove()`, `.pop()`, `.search()`, `.display()`
* Write clean test coverage for your data structures
  * ensure that you've covered any edge cases and tested thoroughly

## Bonus
* 2pts: Implement the ability to take an array of values as an argument to your constructor, and create new Nodes in the data structure for each value in the array.
